            For over 20 years, we at Angela's Dance Academy have aimed to create
            more than just a dance studio for our students. We strive for an
            environment which flourishes talent, drive and creativity. We offer
            a variety of dance styles which in turn creates many well-rounded
            dancers. Some of the styles we offer at ADA include Ballet, Jazz,
            Hip Hop, Street Jazz, Lyrical, Technique as well as extensive
            stretching and conditioning.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our students are able to showcase their hard work in many ways
            throughout the year. We compete in dance competitions, participate
            in various dance performances within our community and of course our
            Annual Dance Show. Along with all of our performances come our very
            original dance costumes. All of our costumes are custom made and
            designed to complement each dance specifically. Each and every one
            of the costumes are hand made personally by our Director, Angela
            Kirshon. Angela combines the vision of the dance, the music along
            with the choreography to create a beautiful final product.
